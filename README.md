**Project Description**
This project focuses on the implementation and exploration of the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), a framework designed for social engineering attacks, including phishing and credential harvesting. The primary goal was to understand how SET can simulate real-world social engineering scenarios and educate individuals on how to protect against such attacks.

**What We Did**
1. SET Installation and Setup:
     * Installed the Social-Engineer Toolkit on macOS.
     * Configured necessary dependencies and resolved issues related to permissions and compatibility.
     * Verified and updated configuration files (e.g., set.config) for proper functionality.
2. Credential Harvesting Attack:
     * Successfully cloned a website using SET to simulate a phishing attack.
     * Configured the IP address and network settings for POST back functionality to capture credentials entered by users.
     * Tested the cloned phishing page locally and on the network to ensure it worked as expected.
3. Documentation:
     * Documented a step-by-step guide for installing, configuring, and using SET for credential harvesting attacks.
